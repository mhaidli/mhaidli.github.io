I am currently looking for 1-2 [interns](../internjourney) to work with me during the Summer of 2025. Interested applicants should apply via https://www.cis.mpg.de/internships/.

<!-- Thank you to everyone who has applied! I have received a lot of applications and a ton of great applicants, and I have now stopped accepting applications. If I seek to hire more interns in the future, I will update my website accordingly. -->

I am not currently looking to hire PhD students or postdocs.
