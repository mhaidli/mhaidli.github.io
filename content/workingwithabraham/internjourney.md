Welcome! I assume you are here because you are considering applying for an internship and want to know what it is like to intern for Abraham? If so, you have come to the right spot!

First, a high level overview: as an intern, you would work closely with me at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) in Bochum, Germany on exciting research looking at emerging technologies and the harms they may pose. All internships are fully funded, covering living costs, housing and roundtrip travel costs. A typical internship lasts 12 to 14 weeks and would take place during the summer period, but longer internships and internships outside of the summer are possible.

## What can you expect to work on as an intern?
As an intern, you will usually be working on one research topic of your choice. I generally offer two types of projects:

The first is what I call a *hands-on project*. In this case, I will already have a project in mind with clearly defined tasks and expectations, and the intern will help out with that specific project. For example, I may be planning a survey study where the research questions are already defined and there is a draft survey protocol; the intern would be in charge of refining that survey, collecting and analyzing data, and (if time permits) helping write up the results in an academic paper. These projects will often be scoped in ways that by the end of the internship, there will be a tangible output (most likely a paper submission).

This is best suited for:
* Those with little to no research experience who want to know what research is like, but are apprehensive of starting a whole project from scratch.
* Those who do not have a particularly strong preference for the research idea or topic they want to conduct, but want to do research of some kind.
* Those who want to practice a specific method and/or dive deep into a specific topic are that I am an expert in.
* Those who prefer hands-on mentorship and guidance
* Those who want a well-scoped project with a tangible output at the end of the internship.

<!-- For this summer, I am planning on having hands-on projects relating to:
* Exploring the harms of brain computer interfaces.
* Better understanding scenario construction processes. 
* Improving the usability of ethical impact assessments and ethical frameworks for developers. -->

The second type is what I call a *hands-off project*. In this project, the intern and I will come up with a research plan together, identifying a topic that matches the intern's own curiosity and expertise. For example, the intern may be interested in learning more about cyberaugmentations, but does not know what to study in them. Together, we would plan a study that allows the intern to explore this area and use their prior expertise with interview methods to. The intern is expected to take ownership of the project. For this type of internship, the intern has the freedom and choice to include the resulting work in your thesis / dissertation if you wish.

This is best suited for:
* Candidates who are PhD students and/or masters students with prior research experience
* Those who prefer to ideate and lead their own project.
* Those who prefer hands-off guidance and working more independently. 
* Those who want to experiment with a new topic, field, or area, without being constrained by deadlines or the expectation of a paper submission
* Those who seek to pursue the project beyond the internship, possibly to use as part of their thesis (e.g., as a chapter in their dissertation)

Having said that, these internship types are rough guidelines as to the projects you can expect. I will work with every intern to craft an internship project that suits their needs and helps them thrive!

## What is Abraham like as a boss?
I wrote a guide about my advising style [here](../advisortraits) -- although the text primarily refers to how I advise PhD students, the same principles apply to how I advise interns as well.


## Requirements for interns
At a minimum, candidates must:
* Be comfortable speaking and writing in English and conducting research in an english-speaking environment.
* Have completed, or are pursuing, an undergraduate degree.
* Be willing to relocate to Bochum for the duration of the internship.

While the following are not required, they will greatly strengthen a candidate's application: 
* Prior research experience.
* Currently in a PhD program.
* Background in computer science, human computer interaction, or information studies.

## How to apply
NOTE: I have stopped receiving internship applications for 2024. If I seek to hire more interns in the future, I will update my website accordingly.

<!-- To apply, please send me an email (abraham dot mhaidli at mpi-sp dot org) with the following in the subject line: Internship-YEAR-Application: YOUR_NAME (E.g., Internship-2024-Application: Abraham Mhaidli). This is a very important step: given the number of emails I receive, I use email filters to automatically sort my email into various folders, so having properly formatted subject lines increases the likelihood it will filter into the right folder and I am more likely to see it.   -->

<!-- In the email, please provide your CV, academic transcript, 1-3 contacts who can act as references, and short cover letter (~1 page). -->

<!-- For your cover letter, please highlight:
* Why you want to work with me 
* What your general research interests are and what types of projects you would be interested in working on. This can be as detailed or vague as you like. I by no means expect a fully fleshed research proposal: it can be as vague as saying "I am interested in studying the privacy risks of videogames."
* Relevant skills and/or experience
* What you are hoping to get out of the research internship  -->

<!-- [Example cover letter] -->

<!-- Successful cover letters:
* **Are specific to me:** I don't want to receive a generic letter that could ostensibly be written for any other internship. Why specifically do you want to study the harms of emerging technologies? Is there something specific about either MPI-SP, Bochum, myself, or my research topics that makes you consider this position? 
* **Are authentic:** If I had to name one thing I want out of a candidate, it is honesty. I would much rather have a candidate be upfront about their flaws rather than someone who bluffs and pretends they have no flaws and are 548583257325x better than they actually are. 
* **Are not written by ChatGPT:** There may come a day when I realize that everyone uses ChatGPT generators, so I give in and allow AI-generated applications. But today is not that day. Please don't use ChatGPT (or other LLM's / AI tools) to write your letter. Spell check tools (e.g., Grammarly) are fine, but don't generate the entire letter from ChatGPT. -->

<!-- Once I receive your cover letter, I will review your application. If selected, you will then move onto the interview phase. -->

<!-- ## Interview phase
*NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE VIEWED AS ROUGH GUIDES. THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS ASKED DURING THE INTERVIEW MAY DIFFER.*

I will usually carry out two interviews with candidates. They will proceed as follows:

The first interview helps me get to know you better, and it will consist of two parts. In the first part, I will ask you to give a brief (7-10) minute presentation about a topic of your choice. This can include presenting on prior research or job experience; a course project; an achievement you are proud of; your desired plans for the internship; a topic you are particularly passionate about; a research paper of your choice; or anything you find interesting. I may ask follow up questions about your presentation.

In the second part of the interview, I will ask more questions about you. The types of questions I will ask:
* Questions about you and your background, including prior education, questions about your research skills and research experience.
* Follow ups on aspects you wrote about in the cover letter (e.g., "You said in your cover letter you wanted to study BLA. What exactly interests you about BLA?")
* If you indicated you preferred a hands-off internship experience, I may ask detailed questions about what topic you want to study and your plans for studying it. If you indicated you wanted a hands-on internship, I may present various research topics to you, and then see whether those are topics you would be interested in studying.

The second interview will be mostly you asking questions for me, and it will be a space where you have the opportunity to get to know me and MPI. This will be a space where you can ask questions about what it's like to work at MPI, my advising style, anything and everything in between.

The goal of these interviews is twofold. 
First, and most importantly, it serves as a way to make sure our personalities align and we get along well. Do we have good rapport? Are our priorities and expectations aligned? Do we think we can have good working chemistry? 
Second, it serves as a verification check. Anyone can use ChatGPT to generate a convincing sounding cover letter. Thus, the interview serves as a way for me to ask you questions and see whether you actually wrote your cover letter and if you know the topics you wrote about. -->
