<!-- Snappy Intro -->
When people think about advertising in VR, there are two reactions:

"Oh yay!" If you are an advertiser.

"Oh crap" if you are a VR user.

This skepticism is not surprising. First, most people dislike ads. They get in the way of content, are unskippable, and are generally annoying. They can also introduce malware, privacy risks, and numerous other harms.
Furthermore, the players dominating the VR space don't inspire much confience. On the one hand you have  ~~Facebook~~ Meta -- the same company that has infamously been selling user data in the form of targeted advertising for profit.
I guess Apple is entering the scene too, with its glorious history of monopolistic practices and [fake pro-privacy posturing](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-apples-privacy-mythology-doesnt-match-reality/). We're still holding out on Valve bringing its next iteration of VR headsets, but until then, Meta is all we really have. It is natural to be distrustful.

<!-- Myself, I have a slightly more nuanced view regarding advertising in VR. But I do worry about its harms quite a bit, and I am convinece that without proper regulation, there will be harms . -->

When talking about the harms of VR advertising, though, most harms seem to center on privacy and manipulation. Privacy because that has been the hot-button topic around advertiing in the last decaed. Manipulation because it is sexy and cool. While these harms are important and worth considering, today I want to introduce another harm to the conversation that has been overlooked: that of **physical harms and emotional distress**.

<!-- Explain what I mean by shockvertising -->
What do I mean by this? I mean VR ads that could cause emotional and/or physical distress in users. For example:
* A VR ad for a horror game where a user is chased by a murderous kinfe-wielding cannibal. The experience itself is realistic and terrifying.
* An ad by an insurance company that wants you to buy life insurance, so it depicts you dying in high definition so as to scare you into buying .
* Anti abortion activists who want to discourage women from having abortions and so send very graphic advertisements depicting babies being murdered to women who are pregnant.
* A VR ad for sports equipment that forces you to engage in very strenous activity in order to complete the ad.
* ADD MORE EXAMPLES.

There are several factors that influence these.hl
<!-- Why is VR different and why are harms different here -->
* Immersiveness: The. The world surrounds you. Moverover. C; future headsets could recreate other senses. As anyone who has used VR can tell you, this 
* Carrying out actions: The majority of non-VR advertising is consumed passively: you see an image, watch a video, read some text, and move on. In VR, manya dvertisements require some interactive component. Sure, there are a few examples where this is the case, such as a mobile game. But (a) these ads in non-VR are in the minority and (b) there is a qualitative difference between doing something on a screen by moving a mouse or swiping a finger, and recreating it in VR.
* Difficulty to escape: In their efforts to be immersive, VR headesets are difficult to escape from. First, the 360 nature of VR means one cannot simply look away. One can close one's eyes, but there is still audio that can itself be distressing (e.g., the sound of a punding hearbeat, screams, etc.). The headset itself is often bulky and difficult to remove.

When
### 1. Shocking advertising isn't anything new.
It is true that shocking advertising is not unique to VR. It's been around a while (and even has a dedicated term: shockvertising).
However, the points I make above make shockvertising in VR more shocking and distressing in VR than in non-VR.

### 2. Aren't you being a little bit hyperbolic?

### 3. VR horror games already exist and tons . WHy is VR advertising any different?
<!-- How is VR ads different from regular VR apps? -->
including VR horror games. However,t here is one key and important difference. When talking about VR horror games, one generally opts into the experience. For one to load up Phasmophopbia, one has to buy it and choose it. Presumably, the user will be expecting distressing, horrifying content. That is not the case with ads. When you opt into ads, you generally opt into receiveing ads, but not the specific ad in question. You could receive an ad that has kittens, or an ad about murderous cannibals chasing you.

A well-intentioned company could think that a VR horror ad is a cool concept, without realizing the broader implication.

### Aren't there already guidelines controlling what can or cannot be advertised?
<!-- What can we do about this -->
There are regulations and guides determining what can and cannot be advertised. For example, EXAMPLES
