## Research Interests
In a broad sense, my research looks at emerging technologies and studies what are their harms and how can we mitigate these harms. 
I am interested in anything and everything related to the ethics of technologies, how technologies can harm users (or prevent harms for users), and how to help designers and legislators better anticipate the harms of the technologies they are creating.

Past topics of interest include:
* Looking at VR advertising to understand how it can be used to manipulate users.
* Examining and determining the privacy risks of new software systems.
* Designing new privacy controls for IoT devices.
* Understanding how developers view the harms of the software they create.

Currently, I am interested in exploring:
* Extended Reality technologies
* Brain computer interfaces
* Ethical impact assessments and ethical development frameworks
* Scenario construction, speculative design, and design fiction.
* Figuring out how (and if) to incorporate ethics into CS education.


Beyond looking at technologies, I am also interested in studying academia and how academics do research. Work includes a look at how academics study and analyze privacy policies, and a position piece on how and why overwork negatively impacts academia. In looking to the future, I am interested in expanding this scope to understand what are challenges that researchers face when conducting research, and what can be done to support them.

With that in mind, I do have very broad research interests. Anything relating to technology, research, and ethics fascinates me.

For an overview of my research, feel free to look through my [publications](../../publications).



## Research Methods
I am open to a wide variety of methods. Some of the methods I have used in the past include:
* Qualitative Interviews
* Content Analysis
* Design fiction
* Speculative Design
* Impact Assessment
* Surveys
* Experiments

But I am always looking to learn and use new methods!

## Research Principles
More than topics, what are my research principles? What broad ideas do I keep in mind when carrying out research?

* **High quality research:** First and foremost, the idea is to make high quality research. Ensure we are using the right methods and doing them rigorously, in the right manner, and get results.

* **Ambitious, but not toxic:** Ambition is a good thing. It pushes us to make high quality work and to push ourselves to create better outcomes. But too much ambition is a bad thing. It can push people to unhealthy extremes, from unhealthy schedules and lack of work-life balance, to unprodcutive stress and anxiety if a paper does not get in. So I push for high quality research, but not at the expense of those doing the research.

<!-- * **Research first, publications second:**
Publications are an important part of research, and the natural stopping point for any study. The common pipeline is: (a) think of an idea (b) execute study (c) write paper (d) publish paper (e) use findings of work for the enxt study. My approach is to first focus on doing good work: once the work is done, then we can focus on getting it published. Too often have I seen researchers do the opposite: first choose a venue, and then decide retroactively what research best fits at that venue and then constructing a study for the whole point. This is harmful for research, since one does nto pursue the best research question, but rather, the research question that is most likely to get published.
Moreover, I don't see publication as a sign of success, and a lack of publication as a sign of failure. For anyone who has gone through the publication process, it is kind of a lottery. Anywhere from three to five random academics look at your paper and decide whether it gets in or not. In theory, ot allows for peer review and a correct vetting of papers, resulting in high quality papers getting. In practice, it all depends on which reviews you get. Do you get kind, sympathetic reviews who are in your area of expertise and buy your argument? Or do you get a grumpy person who is jealous of your work? I have had papers rejected on solid grounds, with the reviewers suggesting ways to improve the methodology and the framing of the paper. I have seen papers get rejected because the reviewrs clearly did not read the paper.I have seen a paper get rejected because it did not cite one single obscure study that was done 15 years prior (in other words, this reviewer was mad we didn't cite their paper). I have seen ChatGPT generated reviews. I have seen bad papers get published, and good papers get rejected. Publications are useful, but in my mind, they are not measure of success. So I choose to focus on carrying out good research first, and then worry about publishing the paper later. -->
* **Research first, publications second:**
Publications are an important part of research: but too often, academics focus first on where they want to publish, and then retroactively construct a study for publishing. I take the opposite approach. First let us do good research: high quality research that matters and is important. Then we can focus on an appropiate venue for it.

* **Spend the time needed to get it right:** A delayed study is eventually good, but a bad study is bad forever. This is an adage first used [to describe videogame development](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-bad-game-is-bad-forever), but it holds true for research aswell. I would rather have a research study be delayed if it means doing things well and right, rather than rushing to publish as much as possible and take several bad shortcuts along the way. 





<!-- I am fascinated by technology. As someone who spen, I witnessed first-hand the rise of social media as a force for good praised by Western media outlets for its role in ``spraeding democracy''. I then saw its catastrophic fall from grace, where social media lost its poster as the golden child and every problem, from spreading misinformation,

This got me thinking: was it  -->
