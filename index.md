Greetings! My name is Abraham Mhaidli. I am a PhD graduate from University of Michigan My research interests lie in the intersection of
technology, society, and privacy. I am particularly interested in studying the ethical issues in extended reality contexts (including VR, AR, MR), and understanding what are ways to help developers make more ethical, less harmful, XR technologies, such as through Ethical Impact Assessments.
