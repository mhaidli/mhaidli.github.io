excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a PhD student studying information sciences at University of Michigan's School of Information. My research interests lie in the intersection of
technology, society, and privacy. I am particularly interested in studying advertising in
technological contexts, to both understand how they are being used and the role they play
in technological ecosystems, as well as understanding the challenges they might pose -- e.g., when everyone has a VR headset, what does advertising look like and what are the ethical issues that arise?

Outside of research, I enjoy rapping, playing and watching soccer, activism, and playing videogames.
