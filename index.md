title: Who am I?
---



Greetings! My name is Abraham Mhaidli. I am a junior research group leader at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/). I received my PhD in 2023 from University of Michigan. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of
technology, society, and privacy. I am particularly interested in studying the ethical issues in extended reality contexts (including VR, AR, MR), and understanding what are ways to help developers make more ethical, less harmful, XR technologies, such as through Ethical Impact Assessments.
